## About Chalk

Chalkâ„¢ captures metadata at build time, and can add a small 'chalk mark' (metadata) to any artifacts, so they can be identified in production. Chalk can also extract chalk marks and collect additional metadata about the operating environment when it does this.

Using Chalk, you can build a graph connecting people, development, builds and production, so that devops engineers understand what is happening in the development process, and so that developers can understand what is happening in the infrastructure.

## How-tos

You can use Chalk to solve a variety of specific use cases such as:

### Create software security supply chain compliance reports automatically

Many companies and the US Government are now mandating suppliers to provide supply chain statements when delivering software. This how to is an easy button to deliver the [software bill of materials (SBOM)](https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials), code and builds provenance and supports [SLSA](https://www.slsa.dev), Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, [level 2](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels) compliance (an emerging supply chain standard) before SLSA [level 1](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels) has been mandated. Follow this how-to on our docs site [here](https://crashoverride.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-create-software-security-supply-chain-compliance-reports-automatically).

### Create and maintain real-time application inventory

From a code base, easily understand the environments where code and even particular branches are running. Gather code owners for the applications and code repos. Follow this how-to on our docs site [here](https://crashoverride.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-create-a-real-time-application-inventory).

### Deploy Chalk globally using Docker

You can deploy Chalk by setting a global alias for Docker and having it call Chalk, so that every build that runs through your build server using Docker, will automatically be 'chalked'. It's a technique that can be combined with chalks ability to deploy tools and configure monitoring, to automatically add security controls and collect information for every application. Follow this how-to on our docs site [here](https://crashoverride.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-deploy-chalk-globally-using-docker)]
