## The `chalk docker` command logic.
##
## Whereas other commands use the `collect` module for their overall
## collection logic, docker is completely different, with two
## different paths where we do collection... chalk extraction, and
## when running docker.
##
## The bits in common to those two things are mainly handled in the
## docker Codec, or in chalk_base when more appropriate.
##
## The extract path still starts in `cmd_extract.nim`, which can even
## make its way into `collect.nim` if specific containers or images
## are requested on the command line.
##
## But when wrapping docker, this module does the bulk of the work and
## is responsible for all of the collection logic.
