## This module implements report caching in the face of sink failures.
##
## If a sink fails, we stick an entry in the report cache, which is
## itself a jsonl file.  The objects in the report cache have three
## fields, one is "$sinks", which is a list of the 'sink-config' names
## for any failed sinks.  The second is "$message", the value of which
## is the JSON report, but put into a JSON string object.  Finally is
## "$topic", which captures the original topic.
##
## Generally, this will just be "report", but custom reports do get
## their own topics, and this cache covers custom reports as well.
##
## When we publish, we must first check the cache.  If there is
## anything left in the cache, then we figure out whether any of the
## 'current' sinks need to catch up.  If so, we UNSUBSCRIBE them from
## the current topic, and re-subscribe them to a topic just for them.
