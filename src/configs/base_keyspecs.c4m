## This file is part of Chalk
## (see https://crashoverride.com/docs/chalk)
##

## This is the first configuration file loaded, and basically provides
## data and defaults. The bulk of it specifies the default metadata
## schema (key blocks).
##
## There's also metadata about the plugin modules and sinks we have
## available.
##
## Actually, everything starting with base_* gets concatenated into one
## big file (kinda like an include):
##
## - base_keyspecs.c4m
## - base_plugins.c4m
## - base_sinks.c4m
## - base_auths.c4m
## - base_chalk_templates.c4m
## - base_report_templates.c4m
## - base_outconf.c4m
## - base_sinkconfs.c4m
##
## Conventions in the naming:
##
## 1. All runtime (i.e., per-operation) keys start with _, their names
##    are otherwise as descriptive as possible.
## 2. INJECTOR_ indicates info about the chalk process that did the chalking.
## 3. For information about the artifact or host that really is just
##    metadata expected only to have  applied at chalk time, the keys will
##    have _CHALKED, or _WHEN_CHALKED at the end, whichever reads more
##    naturally (as determined by me)
## 4. BUILD_ keys relate to the CI/CD process during chalk.
## 5. DOCKER_ keys relate to docker-specific information at the time a
##    `docker build` command was run.
## 6. Things that should be non-varying properties of an artifact itself
##    (including its chalk mark), and not metadata about the artifact's
##    lifecycle, are just named descriptively, including CHALK_ID, SBOM, etc.
##    I also include repo information in here, since such things seldom
##    change.
## 7. _PROCESS keys relate to info gleaned about a running process.
## 8. _IMAGE_ keys relate to info gleaned about a container image locally
##    available via docker.
## 9. _INSTANCE_ keys relate to info gleaned about a running container instance
## 10. _REPO_ keys relate to info gleaned about an image repo for containers
## 11. $ keys are *private* to the chalk implementation.
## 12. If I had any doubt that the runtime key's name might be confused with
##     something that one might expect be collected chalk-time, I added _OP.
##     the more basic per-op stuff such as "_CHALKS" and "ACTION_ID" I did not.

# Field starting with an underscore (_) are "system" metadata fields, that
# are not conceptually part of the chalked metadata.

# Some of these fields may still get added to the chalk mark.
#
# Specifically: MAGIC must always be added, as in many contexts it
# might be necessary for finding the start of the mark.  But it generally
# must not be reported.
#
# _OPERATION, _ACTION_ID, _CURRENT_HASH, and _OP_ERRORS are
# metadata on the current chalk operation, and will not be embedded into
# chalk marks.
#
#
# Any other keys starting with $'s are meant to be reserved for the
# tool's internal use.  This reference implementation adds two:
# - $CHALK_CONFIG, which is used for self-injection of default config
#    data. Like MAGIC, it *does* get added to the mark.
#
# - $CHALK_IMPLEMENTATION_NAME which is used to indicate which version
#      of Chalk this is. It is added as part of the compilation process
#      to indicate this is a Chalk reference implementation binary,
#      which is used to facilitate command wrapping.
#
#      For instance, when wrapping 'docker', Chalk searches the path looking
#      for an _actual_ docker command. The presence of this field will
#      prevent a different chalk from trying to invoke this as 'docker'
#      (it might cause a recursive loop).

# Conforming tools MUST NOT output items consisting of underscores as part
# of a chalk mark (i.e., any extract operations).
#
# Similarly, system metadata fields unknown to the implementation SHOULD
# NOT be output under any circumstances, to discourage users from adding
# new metadata keys to the space.
#
# User-defined MUST begin with the X- prefix.

This is a unique identifier for an *unchalked* software artifact. When

Chalk marks are always four groups of characters separated by dashes;
the first and last group are six characters, and the middle two groups
four characters.

The non-dash characters are taken from a base32 character set, and the
letters will always be upper case.

Any time a chalk mark is created for a piece of software, this field
must be part of the mark.

unchalked artifact (we encoded 100 bits from the hash). This helps
ensure that different machines will calculate the same `CHALK_ID` on
the same artifact.

Currently, the hash is used for calculating this value for all
artifact types *EXPECT* docker images, where we cannot reliably get
such a value. In that case, the value is randomly selected, and will
be different every time.

This identifier differs from the `METADATA_ID` in that the `CHALK_ID`
is a unique identifier for the unchalked artifact, whereas
`METADATA_ID` is a unique identifier for the *CHALKED* artifact. A

chalk HASH algorithm will see they're the same artifact, but the file
system hashes would definitely differ.

Also, for some codecs, due to file format complexities, if you DELETE
a chalk mark from an artifact, you may not get the same bits back as
before any chalk mark was inserted.

That's because there's a normalization process applied, and reversing
it is not worth the effort, especially for things like ZIP files and
ELF binaries, where the logic involved would be complex, and it would
also require storing data.

The codec-specific normalization process ensures the artifact
semantics are always valid, and that we have a consistent way to
hash. It just doesn't always enable recovering the original bits.

Nonetheless:

1. The `_CURRENT_HASH` key will always give you the hash of the file
on the file system, at the end of the current operation.

2. For file system artifacts, The `PRE_CHALK_HASH` field will give the
file system hash before insertion. __However__, this is calculated
without considering whether it is already chalked of not.

Additionally, some types of artifact (particularly Docker containers)
may not have a pre-chalk HASH value that we can easily compute, in
which case this field will not be reported.

See `chalk help hashing` for more information.

This field is used to help authenticate the rest of the metadata
placed into the chalk mark. It constitutes a hash of all the metadata
that is in the actual chalk mark.

Again, this is NOT derived from the insertion-time report; instead, it
is derived from the remainder chalk mark itself. That way, whenever
the chalk mark is extracted, the contents can be validated, thus
detecting whether software has been changed since marked.

For instance, if you mark a shell script, and then edit it, you will
get a validation error on any subsequent operation involving that
artifact until a new mark is inserted, the changes are reverted, or
the mark is deleted.

We use a simple binary normalization format for the hash, which sorts
keys in a well-known order. `METADATA_ID` isn't used in this
computation since it is derived from the `METADATA_HASH`, and
signature-related fields are not used, since they sign this value.

Whenever available at chalk time, the `HASH` field should be added to
artifacts (or the `CHALK_ID`, which would be derived from the same
value), in which case the `METADATA_HASH` protects the integrity of
the entire artifact, not just the associated metadata.

The `METADATA_ID` field is derived from the `METADATA_HASH` value, but
is more human-readable. It can also be used for metadata integrity,
which is why this field is not strictly required in a chalk mark.
