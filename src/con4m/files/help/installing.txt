%{H Installing Con4m}%

Con4m is distributed from {bold}https://github.com/crashappsec/con4m{reset}.

Currently, it is in pre-release, so needs a Nim compiler to build the con4m compiler and libcon4m.a.

%{h Building from source}%
Con4m is currently written against Nim 1.6.10, which can easil be installed via 'choosenim'. On most OSes, this can be installed from the command line with:

%{c
curl https://nim-lang.org/choosenim/init.sh -sSf | sh
}%

For windows, visit: https://github.com/dom96/choosenim/releases

Once Nim is installed, you will need to update the package manager. Run:
%{c
nimble install nimble
}%

You can then simply run:

%{c
nimble install https://github.com/crashappsec/con4m
}%

This will put the con4m binary in your Nim path (usually, ~/.nimble/bin/con4m), and will place libcon4m.a in ~/lib/libcon4m.a
