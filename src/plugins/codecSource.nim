  ## This function is intended to be used from plugins for artifacts
  ## where we have text files that are marked by adding one-line
  ## comments.
  ##
  ## Specifically, this function gets used in two scenarios:
  ##
  ## a) When we first scan the file.  In that scenario, we need the
  ## hash of the as-unmarked artifact and the extracted info, if any.
  ##
  ## b) When we remove a chalk mark, and want to write out the new
  ## content.
  ##
  ## To support those use cases, we return the contents of the file
  ## (it can then be either hashed or written), along with the dict
  ## extracted from Json, which the delete operation will just be
  ## ignoring.
  ##
  ## Generally, we expect this to get called 2x on a delete operation.
  ## We *could* cache contents, or a location in the file stream, but
  ## there are some cases where we might want to NOT cache and might
  ## possibly have underlying file changes (specifically, ZIP files
  ## and any other nested content will have their objects stick around
  ## until the outmost object is done processing).
  ##
  ## The protocol here for removing chalk marks that aren't on a
  ## comment boundary exactly as we would have added them is that we
  ## replace the mark's JSON with: { "MAGIC" : "dadfedabbadabbed" }
  ##
  ## We call this the "chalk placeholder".
  ##
  ## If the user hand-added it before we replaced the mark, we might not
  ## get the spacing quite the same as what the user had before hand,
  ## because we make no move to perserve that.
  ##
  ## To ensure consistency of the hashes we use to generate CHALK IDs,
  ## when using the placeholder, the hash we use for the purposes of
  ## chalking should be based on the placeholder with spacing as above,
  ## instead of the user's spacing.  That means, the hash we use as the
  ## 'pre-chalk' hash might be different than the on-file-system hash,
  ## were you to run sha256 on the as-is-file.
  ##
  ## Seems like a decent enough trade-off, and we have already made a
  ## similar one in ZIP files.

    # If we are on a comment line by ourselves, in the format that we
    # would have written, then we will delete the entire line.
    # Otherwise, we replace the mark with the constant `emptyMark`.
    #
    # For us to delete the comment line, we require the following
    # conditions to be true:
    #
    # 1. Before the mark, we must see EXACTLY a newline, the comment
    #    sequence (usually just #) and then a single space.
    #
    # 2. After the mark ends, we must see EITHER a newline or EOF.
    #
    # In any other case, we treat the mark location as above where we
    # insert `emptyMark` instead of removing the whole line.
    #
    # We do it this way because, if we don't see `emptyMark` in an
    # unmarked file, this is the way we will add the mark, full stop.
    # If there's a marked file with extra spaces on the comment line,
    # either it was tampered with after marking (which the unchalked
    # hash would then be able to determine), *or* the user wanted the
    # comment line to look the way it does, and indicated such by
    # adding `emptyMark`.
