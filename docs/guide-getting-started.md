# Getting Started with Chalk

Welcome to Chalk, the open-source observability tool that provides full
lifecycle visibility for your software by Crash Override. Whether you're
looking to track software from development to production, enhance your supply
chain security, or create a comprehensive application inventory, Chalk offers a
powerful yet straightforward approach to software metadata management.

This Getting Started guide will walk you through the essentials of Chalk, from
installation to example integrations with your CI/CD pipelines. By following
these sections in order, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of Chalk's
core capabilities and be ready to implement it in your own environment.

## Your Learning Path

We recommend working through these sections in sequence, as each builds upon
the concepts introduced in the previous ones:

### 1. [Installation Guide](./install.md)

Begin your journey by installing Chalk on your system. This section covers both
downloading pre-built binaries (the simplest approach) and building Chalk from
source. You'll learn how to set up Chalk so it's ready to use in your local
environment or deployment pipelines.

### 2. [Chalk Basics](./guide-quick-start.md)

Once Chalk is installed, this section will introduce you to the fundamental
operations: chalk marking binaries and container images, extracting chalk
marks to view embedded metadata, and configuring basic reporting. These simple
examples will help you understand Chalk's core functionality and provide a
foundation for more advanced usage.

### 3. [Using Chalk Exec Reports](./guide-exec.md)

After mastering the basics, dive into Chalk's powerful execution reporting
capabilities. Learn how to capture runtime information about your applications,
set up heartbeat monitoring for continuous observation, and customize reporting
to focus on the data most relevant to your needs. This section bridges the gap
between build-time metadata and runtime behavior.

### 4. [Integrating with CI/CD](./guide-ci-cd.md)

With a solid understanding of Chalk's capabilities, you will be ready to
implement it in your development workflows. This section explores how to
integrate Chalk into popular CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI,
Jenkins, CircleCI, and Azure DevOps. You'll learn best practices for automating
metadata collection and ensuring consistent marking across your artifacts.

## What Comes Next?

After completing these initial sections, you will have a strong foundation in
Chalk's core functionality. From there, you can explore more advanced topics
based on your specific needs:

- Customizing configurations for specialized use cases
- Setting up digital signing and attestation
- Implementing SBOM generation and security scanning
- Configuring advanced reporting workflows

Each of these topics builds upon the fundamentals covered in the Getting
Started guide, allowing you to gradually expand your use of Chalk as your needs
evolve.

Ready to begin? Start with [installing Chalk](./install.md) and take
the first step toward comprehensive software lifecycle observability.
